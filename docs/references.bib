    abstract = {A correlation for the thermal conductivity of helium has been developed which covers the temperature range from temperatures just above the lambda line to 830 K, and densities up to about 160 kg m−3. The data used incorporate some recent experimental results which cover the temperature range from 4 K to 20 K including the critical region. The correlation gives an equation which generally fits the experimental data within ± 5%. However, at low temperature, the experimental data deviate up to about 10% from predictions based upon viscosity measurements or molecular dynamics calculations.}

    abstract = {{A new thermal conductivity equation λ=λ(T,ρ) in a multiparameter format was developed for carbon dioxide through the application of an optimization technique of the functional form. The proposed equation is valid for temperatures from the triple point (Tt=216.592K; Pt=0.51795MPa) to 1000K and pressures up to 200MPa. The calculation of density, which is an independent variable of the equation, from the experimental (T,P) conditions is performed with a high accuracy equation of state for the fluid. The thermal conductivity equation shows an average absolute deviation of 1.19\% on the selected 1407 primary data points. Its performances are slightly better than those of the corresponding conventional model by Vesovic et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 19, 763 (1990)] available from the literature; moreover the new equation is simpler to use in particular for the near-critical region. Tables of generated values of carbon dioxide thermal conductivity are provided for check of the code implementations and for quick evaluations.}},
