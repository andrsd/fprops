    abstract = {A correlation for the thermal conductivity of helium has been developed which covers the temperature range from temperatures just above the lambda line to 830 K, and densities up to about 160 kg m−3. The data used incorporate some recent experimental results which cover the temperature range from 4 K to 20 K including the critical region. The correlation gives an equation which generally fits the experimental data within ± 5%. However, at low temperature, the experimental data deviate up to about 10% from predictions based upon viscosity measurements or molecular dynamics calculations.}

The proposed equation is valid for temperatures from the triple point (Tt=216.592K; Pt=0.51795MPa) to 1000K and pressures up to 200MPa. The calculation of density, which is an independent variable of the equation, from the experimental (T,P) conditions is performed with a high accuracy equation of state for the fluid. The thermal conductivity equation shows an average absolute deviation of 1.19\% on the selected 1407 primary data points. Its performances are slightly better than those of the corresponding conventional model by Vesovic et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 19, 763 (1990)] available from the literature; moreover the new equation is simpler to use in particular for the near-critical region. Tables of generated values of carbon dioxide thermal conductivity are provided for check of the code implementations and for quick evaluations.}},

A new wide range equation of state is presented and expressed analytically in the form of the free energy as a function of density and temperature. This fundamental equation contains, in addition to pure polynomial and “BWR”-terms, new exponential functions especially convenient for the critical region. To guarantee an effective structure, the combination of the terms of the equation was found by using an optimization method recently developed. As a result, the optimized function for the free energy is capable of representing the thermodynamic surface of oxygen in the range 54 ≤ T ≤ 300 K, 0 < p ≤ 818 bar and 0 < ρ ≤ 41 mol dm−3 within the experimental uncertainty of the data available. With the exception of very few items of data, this statement is also valid for the whole coexistence curve and the critical region. Extrapolations of this new equation beyond the range of data yield physically meaningful results.}

The fundamental equation explicit in Helmholtz energy by Schmidt and Wagner has been used for the calculation of the property tables presented here, and for comparisons of calculated properties to the experimental data. The formulation of Stewart and Jacobsen is used in this paper in comparisons of properties calculated by the two formulations. These comparisons provide the basis for independent assessment of the accuracy of the available data and calculated properties. The procedures used in determining the formulations by Wagner and Schmidt, and by Stewart and Jacobsen were published earlier. The fundamental equation is valid for thermodynamic properties of oxygen from the freezing line to 300 K at pressures to 80 MPa. A separate vapor pressure equation and equations for the saturated liquid and saturated vapor densities and the ideal gas heat capacity are included. Functions for calculating internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, isochoric heat capacity (Cv), isobaric heat capacity (Cp) and velocity of sound are also included. Tables of thermodynamic properties of oxygen are given within the range of validity of the fundamental equation. The fundamental equation reported here may be used to calculate densities with an uncertainty of 0.10 percent, heat capacities within 2.0 percent, and velocity of sound values within 1.0 percent. These uncertainty values are valid for the range outside of the critical region. Comparisons of calculated properties to experimental data are included to verify the accuracy of the formulation.}",

    abstract = "{This work reviews the data on thermodynamic properties of methane which were available up to the middle of 1991 and presents a new equation of state in the form of a fundamental equation explicit in the Helmholtz free energy. A new strategy for optimizing the structure of empirical thermodynamic correlation equations was used to determine the functional form of the equation. The Helmholtz function containing 40 fitted coefficients was fitted to selected experimental data of the following properties: (a) thermal properties of the single phase (pρT) and (b) of the liquid‐vapor saturation curve (psρ′ρ″) including the Maxwell criterion, (c) speed of sound w, (d) isochoric heat capacity cv, (e) isobaric heat capacity cp, (f) difference of enthalpy Δh, and (g) second virial coefficient B. Independent equations are also included for the vapor pressure, the saturated liquid and vapor densities, the isobaric ideal gas heat capacity and the melting pressure as functions of temperature. Tables for the thermodynamic properties of methane from 90 K to 620 K for pressures up to 1000 MPa are presented. For the density, uncertainties of ±0.03\\% for pressures below 12 MPa and temperatures below 350 K and ±0.03\\% to ±0.15\\% for higher pressures and temperatures are estimated. For the speed of sound, the uncertainty ranges from ±0.03\\% to ±0.3\\% depending on temperature and pressure. Heat capacities may be generally calculated within an uncertainty of ±1\\%. To verify the accuracy of the new formulation, the calculated property values are compared with selected experimental results and existing equations of state for methane. The new equation of state corresponds to the new International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS‐90) and is extrapolable up to pressures of 20000 MPa.}",

The correlations are based on a critical evaluation of the available experimental data and have been developed to represent these data over a broad range of the state variables. Estimates for the accuracy of the equations and comparisons with measured properties are given. The reasons for this new study of methane include significant new and more accurate data, and improvements in the correlation functions which allow increased accuracy of the correlations especially in the extended critical region. For the thermodynamic properties, a classical equation for the molar Helmholtz energy, which contains terms multiplied by the exponential of the quadratic and quartic powers of the system density, is used. The resulting equation of state is accurate from about 91 to 600 K for pressures \\&lt;100 MPa and was developed by considering PVT, second virial coefficient, heat capacity, and sound speed data. Tables of coefficients and equations are presented to allow the calculation of these and other thermodynamic quantities. Ancillary equations for properties along the liquid–vapor phase boundary, which are consistent with the equation of state and lowest order scaling theory, are also given. For the viscosity of fluid methane, a low‐density contribution based on theory is combined with an empirical representation of the excess contribution. The approximate range of the resulting correlation is 91 to 400 K for pressures \\&lt;55 MPa. The correlation for the thermal conductivity includes a theoretically based expression for the critical enhancement; the range for the resulting correlation is about 91 to 700 K for pressures below 100 MPa.}",
