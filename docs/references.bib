    abstract = {A correlation for the thermal conductivity of helium has been developed which covers the temperature range from temperatures just above the lambda line to 830 K, and densities up to about 160 kg m−3. The data used incorporate some recent experimental results which cover the temperature range from 4 K to 20 K including the critical region. The correlation gives an equation which generally fits the experimental data within ± 5%. However, at low temperature, the experimental data deviate up to about 10% from predictions based upon viscosity measurements or molecular dynamics calculations.}

    abstract = {{A new thermal conductivity equation λ=λ(T,ρ) in a multiparameter format was developed for carbon dioxide through the application of an optimization technique of the functional form. The proposed equation is valid for temperatures from the triple point (Tt=216.592K; Pt=0.51795MPa) to 1000K and pressures up to 200MPa. The calculation of density, which is an independent variable of the equation, from the experimental (T,P) conditions is performed with a high accuracy equation of state for the fluid. The thermal conductivity equation shows an average absolute deviation of 1.19\% on the selected 1407 primary data points. Its performances are slightly better than those of the corresponding conventional model by Vesovic et al. [J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 19, 763 (1990)] available from the literature; moreover the new equation is simpler to use in particular for the near-critical region. Tables of generated values of carbon dioxide thermal conductivity are provided for check of the code implementations and for quick evaluations.}},

A new wide range equation of state is presented and expressed analytically in the form of the free energy as a function of density and temperature. This fundamental equation contains, in addition to pure polynomial and “BWR”-terms, new exponential functions especially convenient for the critical region. To guarantee an effective structure, the combination of the terms of the equation was found by using an optimization method recently developed. As a result, the optimized function for the free energy is capable of representing the thermodynamic surface of oxygen in the range 54 ≤ T ≤ 300 K, 0 < p ≤ 818 bar and 0 < ρ ≤ 41 mol dm−3 within the experimental uncertainty of the data available. With the exception of very few items of data, this statement is also valid for the whole coexistence curve and the critical region. Extrapolations of this new equation beyond the range of data yield physically meaningful results.}

    abstract = "{A joint project by the authors has resulted in two new thermodynamic property formulations for oxygen. The fundamental equation explicit in Helmholtz energy by Schmidt and Wagner has been used for the calculation of the property tables presented here, and for comparisons of calculated properties to the experimental data. The formulation of Stewart and Jacobsen is used in this paper in comparisons of properties calculated by the two formulations. These comparisons provide the basis for independent assessment of the accuracy of the available data and calculated properties. The procedures used in determining the formulations by Wagner and Schmidt, and by Stewart and Jacobsen were published earlier. The fundamental equation is valid for thermodynamic properties of oxygen from the freezing line to 300 K at pressures to 80 MPa. A separate vapor pressure equation and equations for the saturated liquid and saturated vapor densities and the ideal gas heat capacity are included. Functions for calculating internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, isochoric heat capacity (Cv), isobaric heat capacity (Cp) and velocity of sound are also included. Tables of thermodynamic properties of oxygen are given within the range of validity of the fundamental equation. The fundamental equation reported here may be used to calculate densities with an uncertainty of 0.10 percent, heat capacities within 2.0 percent, and velocity of sound values within 1.0 percent. These uncertainty values are valid for the range outside of the critical region. Comparisons of calculated properties to experimental data are included to verify the accuracy of the formulation.}",
